  "summary_long": "I build cloud-native data infrastructure that gives business teams the clarity to make faster, smarter decisions. At Amazon, I've delivered EU-wide data tools and real-time monitoring systems that directly contributed to multi-million dollars in operational savings.\n\nMy career path into data engineering began with a profound life changing decision: moving to London where I earned a Master's in Data Science and rebuilt my career from the ground up. That allowed me to get involved in data science projects at Datasite (fintech) and made a lateral career move into data analysis. Currently, I specialize in creating scalable data architecture on AWS, with a focus on turning complex data into reliable, accessible resources that empower teams and improve operations.\n\nBut life is not just about work, and when I am not working I like exploring the creative side of things by making travel videos or playing instruments, and any sport that challenges body and mind.",

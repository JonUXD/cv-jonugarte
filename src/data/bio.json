  "summary_long": "I build cloud-native data infrastructure that gives business teams the clarity to make faster, smarter decisions. At Amazon, I've delivered EU-wide data tools and real-time monitoring systems that directly contributed to over $18M in operational savings.\n\nMy career path into data engineering began with a decisive shift: moving to London to earn a Master's in Data Science and rebuild my career from the ground up. This experience translates into a practical focus on building data systems that serve a clear business purpose. I specialize in creating scalable data architecture on AWS, with a focus on turning complex data into reliable, accessible resources that empower teams and improve operations.\n\nOutside of work, I enjoy the creative process of photography and making travel videos—a different kind of project that balances out the structured world of data.",
